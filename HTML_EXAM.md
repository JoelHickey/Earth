_______________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________

## Answer Key (For Self-Study)

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answers</summary>

**Section 1:**
1.1: C
1.2: B  
1.3: B
1.4: B

**Section 2:**
2.1: Directly in the HTML file with all the markup
2.2: In React component files (TravelOldFlow.jsx) using JSX
2.3: False - Browser HTML is generated by React
2.4: Because React builds all the HTML in JavaScript and injects it into the root div
2.5: B
2.6: C

**Section 3:**
3.1: 2, 3, 1, 4, 5
3.2: C
3.3: A
3.4: index.html (line 6, the `<title>` tag)
3.5: False - It's a Single Page Application

**Section 4:**
4.1: Reusability, state management, only updates what changed, component composition
4.2: C
4.3: An app that loads once and updates content dynamically without page refreshes
4.4: Generated by React from your JSX/component code
4.5: To improve code maintainability, reusability, and scalability - refactoring improves structure, not UI

**Bonus:**
- index.html = Empty stage/foundation
- React = Theater company building the set
- Components = Individual props/actors/scenes
- The browser = The audience seeing the final show
